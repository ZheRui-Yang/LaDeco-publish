# LaDeco in OneFormer segmentation engine

Since MXNet is not user friendly enough at installation for Microsoft WindowsÂ© user even today, here we provide another choice which is implemented on PyTorch.

# Installation

It is the most convient to install using [Anaconda][] or [Miniconda][].

## Windows & Linux

```console
conda env create
```

For CPU only inference, use `environ_cpu.yml` to install
```console
conda env create --file environ_cpu.yml
```

## MacOS

```bash
conda env create --file environ_MacOS.yml
```

Note, MPS acceleration is available on MacOS 12.3+.
